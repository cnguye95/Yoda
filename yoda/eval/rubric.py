"""Pydantic models for the Phase 9 model-as-judge rubric.

DimensionScore holds a 1-5 integer score plus a one-sentence justification.
JudgeScores is the top-level model returned by judge_report(); it maps five
evaluation dimensions to DimensionScore instances and adds an overall comment.

These models are also used as the Anthropic tool input schema so the judge
call returns structured data directly without manual JSON parsing.
