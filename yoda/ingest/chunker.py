"""Splits a cleaned SEC filing into section-tagged chunks for embedding.

The one public function, chunk_filing(), takes the plain text produced by
edgar._clean_html() and returns a list of Chunk objects. Each Chunk carries the
text, its section label (e.g. "MD&A"), its position in the original text, and
a sequential index so callers can reconstruct ordering.

Section detection strategy:
  - Scan every line for short heading-like lines (3–150 chars) that match a
    regex pattern tied to a known 10-Q/10-K section.
  - SEC filings repeat each heading in the table-of-contents AND in the body.
    We keep the LAST occurrence of each section heading so the body wins over
    the TOC, avoiding 20-char ghost sections.
  - Any text before the first matched heading is labelled "Other".

Within-section splitting:
  - Sections are split into overlapping 1500-char windows with 200-char
    overlap. If the cut-point lands mid-paragraph, it backs up to the most
    recent double-newline so we don't chop sentences.
